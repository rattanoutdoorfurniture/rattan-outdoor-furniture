#Rattan Outdoor Furniture#

##Overview##
This file will contain daily update information, along with general todos and
should generally cover the progress made and to be made on the Rattan Outdoor
Furniture web site project.

##Notes:##
I wanted to start a more general notes section of this file.
Here I will append this section with little notes relative to what I'm working on.
More detailed than in the TODO section, but more general than the change log.

* When there are no color optoins left for a product, magento assumes you will not sell it without a color option to choose. This is something we will have to decice what we want to do. I am thinking that we make a kind of "default" color, so people can still order the product.
* Each product will have 4 images, not 3. The main image should not be re-used in the thumbnail section. (Really weird when cycling through the photos to see the same one twice.)
* Collections section. Like Products, but a top-level category that is called collections, and each collection is a sub-category of that, and all products of a collection (the site [skinny] viewable ones anyway). This does not have to be added to the main menu, but could be. It could also replace the "related" products on the cateogry page (cause that's kind of what a category page is already), so have a "Collections" section below the lounger results, where it would list 4 collections, going to that collection page.

##Global TODO:##
* MUST DO: A Magento DATABASE BACKUP BEFORE __EVERY__ COMMIT!
* MUST DO: When you fix something COMMIT IT BEFORE DOING __ANYTHING__ ELSE!
* MUST DO: Remember to update project-develop repo. This will house all project related files (workspace XML and such, cleaning out the develop branch).

* Update Item Quantity in cart. (Same section as clear cart. Don't waste time on this, as I have a feature development planned for this section.)
* Global search functionality
* Add functionality to footer newsletter form
* Product reviews (just remove the reviews section for now.)
* Create all sub-category pages. These are going to be based on keyword lists
* Create all products for all sub-category pages. Attach images, details, price, color, and inventory.
* 4 Images per product
* If we're making collections pages, which we should, a link to the collection page for each product should be on the product page. like "View Collection" or something.
* Reset secure URL for checkout when going live (this obviously fails on an unseccured, local connection.)
* Add To Cart button on the category page. We'll have to decide how we're gonna handle the colors for this. I think it may be best to redirect them to the product page, with attention on the color.
* Shipping Methods waiting for destination address before displaying options (which should not be dependant on this).
* Style Credit Card input section to mimic the layout on a credit card. (Worry about this when we settle on the payment processor.)
* Accounts / Login / Automatic account creation for guest checkout (already generates a temporary password.)
* Work on form validation in the checkout. This should not try to validate fields that the user has not yet tried to enter data into.
* User must select a color option if available, or we need to make this default to the first color, but I would like to alert them that they need to choose.

* [DONE]     Work on the PayPal credentials. (This is bouncing back with an API error).
* [DONE]     Figure out how we want to handle orders that do not have any available color options (this may be playing a part in why the add-to-cart is broken.)
* [DONE]     Color swatches on Product page. for now just assign a name for each fake color, and pass that along.
* [DONE]     Fix "Selected" main menu style
* [DONE]     Add-To-Cart bug!!!
* [DONE]     TONIGHT(2014-05-06): Think over other options as to why this is not working. Perhaps a little break from the code will give me a fresh view on the issue. This often helps.
* [DONE]     Merge retro branch (working add-to-cart code) with the develop branch (who's add-to-cart code is broken). The develop branch has further work of styling, but this is the purpose of GIT, so that different work can be done, and synced later.
* [DONE]     Create Main Category Pages (As they are noted on the design)
* [FIXED]    Finalize and Normalize canonicalization of category / product links (also fixed canonical link (html element), which is readable by google, so the lineage of the site should be good now. (SEO Win)
* [FIXED]    Add color options to the Product in the Magento Backend. This way we can remove a color if it's out of stock. (begin working on this now)
* [KEYWORDS] Decide Product Categories and create pages/categories


##Change Log:##

###2014-05-20###
* After our brief meeting this morning, and organizing my notes, I am going to being into Market research (that's why I didn't waste time entering my KeywordSpy notes into Keep as I figure I will do this as I find good methods of usage in KeywordSpy But this is where I am going to start now. As Larry and I talked, we want to see the keywords used by the big players and the smaller mom-and-pop type shops. I am going to work on creating keyword lists, Pay-Per-Click, and (focused on) organic. I would like to compare these to show what is working for them, what they're paying for, and what we don't have to. We would also like to target some of this at the "trickery" some of the other sites are doing. This sort of thing should expose itself relatively easily as I get going. I will make another note here with progress, but I plan on doing a lot of printing of lists and such so we can mark on them and get a good visual.
* This morning we had a little meeting about what we're doing and where we're going with this. We're running out of time before Larry goes to China, so we are re-shuffling our priorities and trying to get as much accomplished before that as possible. I've started by getting all my notes organized into Google Keep. Might as well take advantage of the services we're paying for, and the features in the application are awesome. Searchability alone makes it worth while. Plus color coding and reminders on your phone, just plain sweet! But now I have all those post it notes from my desk organized in there. I left the keyword spy notes out as to not clutter it up. They are less thougth out notes, and do not translate well to being kept there. I would like to re-organize these into Keep today as I do some market research, in a way that will be more helpful in the future. As I figure out good methods to using the KeywordSpy utility, I will note these in Keep. (Moving up to a new bullet.)

###2014-05-19###
* Day off after Spring Sale (Wooo! Damn how I needed that!)

###2014-05-16###
* I figured I should make a little note here just to keep consistant with noting my day's progress. I am currently doing Market research. I've been having a little more of an extended look at Ohana wicker. After doing a more in depth professional review, their site sucks. They are lacking in a lot of way. i know they are under development, but the site is shotty, and missing a lot of elements. I am now going to look at some of their (and by extension, our) competitors. I am focusing on the list Larry gave me. I want to focus directly on wickercentral, as he has a good site, that we know is run by magento, so I want to see what he is doing, and how he is doing it. I am going to use keywordspy to get some info, and then compare that to their organic results. I will also print a keyword list, like i had done for Ohana Wicker.
* Fixed PayPal!!! Woo. Okay, so after going through some really vague errors, I was able to resolve the issue. It looks like it may have been some combination of Magento trying to cache the validation values, and the account not being configured correctly. So, for future reference, if this is ever to happen again, or when going live. I removed the credentials (again) from the magento backend. I then cleared the cache. logged out. and back in. Re-requested the API credentials. Entered the Sandbox values. Saved, cleared cache. logged out. logged back in. Cleared browser cache. Re-added products to cart. Went thru full process, and it eventually worked. The kicker was that I had to configure (on paypal's side) to accept this payment. I am not sure how this is supposed to be found out, but in the text account area, you had to "enable" the payments pro option (which in hindsight seems incredibly obvious, but I hadn't found anything about it until researching the 10501 error.) Everything looks good with the paypal setup from here. I have an invoice, order, payment made on paypal. I'll print all this stuff out. Also, the automatic account creation worked well. Logged me in automatically. And shows me my order history. This all needs to be styled, but that falls into that Magento Internal pages that has been back-burnered for a couple weeks now while setting up this (far more important) front facing pages and payment processing. There are quite a few little bugs in the checkout. Nothing that prevents checkout as far as I know. Just like, when you enter your phone number, then it offeres shipping methods. This is weird. I was working on it previously, but getting the payment processing working was of far higher priority. Now that this is working, I will be able to get back to those other items. Also, Larry and I have already planned on discussing the small attributes of this process. We would like to spend next week finding all the little bugs and oddities on the site that we want me to spend the next month fixing. I am going to enjoy what I will call a well deserved cigarette. And then go ahead and backup, sync, push/pull the repos. And that way I will have a clean start for development tomorrow/monday (whenever that actually happens). I will also print off all this stuff. But when I get back in, my main focus will be more Market Research, as stated previously.
* I also wanted to note that I took a moment to eat my sandwiches, which I did while working. This is kind of my normal practice at this point, but I figured that since I had the error response from paypal, and The server is looking really good, that I would give AT&T a call after I ate. So I did that quickly. I was only on the phone for 10 minutes. The lady seemed helpful, but I'm not sure I believe her. She says that the internet at my home will be turned on today before 8PM. Larry and I discussed what I will do if it is not. But, she assured me that it will be. I am going to continue working on this PayPal error response, do some googling, and perhaps just give paypal a call if i do not find a solution quickly. I do still want to allot the last 2 hours of the day to some Market Research. I need to have everything wrapped up, backed up and synced before I begin this. I would like to be able to be done with PayPal after today. I'm not sure how far I will be able to get within the next hour. I will make an additional note after I do a little research into this error (or, as i expect) after I call and talk to a PayPal representative.
* I now have everything running quite well on the server. I had some path issues which I have fixed. Mainly with the GeoIP database. This was a relatively quick fix. This fix is actually in the version control as it was a server file issue, so you can actually see the steps taken on bitbucket. But beyond this small fix, I re-configured the PayPal application, and to some avail. I am now getting an error code 10002, which PayPal says could be one of several errors, they tend to be extremely vague with these errors due to the fact that they do not want to return any sensitive information. This is a good thing for production, but seems like they would be a little more lenient in testing. they are not. So I think I have it wittled down to a specific issue with the authentication. it's saying something about authentication headers. This could be a request error or something not matching up on paypal's end. As I said, they won't tell me exactly what is wrong, but I do believe it is a security authentication issue. I may end up just calling PayPal to get this issue resolved.
* This morning I began by getting right into the server stuff. I did a lot of work with Git this morning, trying to get everything settled on the server correctly. If you look in the bitbucket, you should be able to see what I mean. Larry and I did some talking about it this morning. Without too much delay, I would like to get back into that. currently I am getting back into removing the .idea (project resources) folder into the resources repository. This just makes sense. and this folder has been cluttering up my development repo. I do not like this. But I do very much like the contents of this folder being under version control. It is majorly beneficial to keeping on task, and knowing where I left off for the next day. (__Hugely__ beneficial.) So I just have a little more work to do to get this synced over on the other repo. Then I will have a clean develop branch, where I can be certain that all files are required, and I do not have to worry about the line endings of files that are not necessary. I will make another note here shortly with progress.
* This note I am making after the above one. I wanted to jot down real quickly what the morning consisted of. I jumped right into the server config (as you can see on git), and I am working on cleaning the repos. Once Larry got here we talked real quick about today's game plan. I went over what I was doing, and the point that once the repo is clean, I will begin configuring the server for PayPal. We got the login all figured out for this. And then we took a look at some SEO stuff. Brutted around with this for a mooment. I was diving into HandyRents.com Rich Snippet code. I've made some post-it notes about this to come back to later on today or next week perhaps (this is in that meta development we discussed, which at the current moment is on the back burner: from a development standpoint.) so without wasting any more time, I'm going to wrap up the server configuration, so that I can begin back into getting paypal endpoints and everything configured.
* Oh, relevant note, I created a "Rattan Outdoor Furniture" app on PayPal's side. This is what the one guy on the phone was talking about. He did a horrible job of explaining it. he is obviously not a developer. But now that is in place, and just must be linked with Magento (which is what I'm talking about when I say configure PayPal.) Again, I will update these notes when I know more after diving into it. (PayPal is rather vast, and has very many options, all of which are very locked down (they're crazy about security, but that's good thing.)

###2014-05-15###
* I have spent the last few hours making sure that the development server is in sync with everything I have been working on recently. This is something I have been avoiding for multiple reasons. The main reason having been security, I had figured out earliser this morning. I am limiting the available users by IP address, so that way PayPal will be able to reach our server, as well as our office machines (and of course local, for the database and whatnot.) This issue was relatively easily fixed with the addition of a simple plugin (free to boot), which I installed, and configured with PayPal's endpoint IP addresses (which the domain list is here: https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/api/endpoints/). The __MUCH__ larger issue is that I am developing on a windows computer. Windows does __NOT__ get along with Unix. Which, is the sub-system that runs our server. Our server is Linux, (which plays a little nicer, and accounts for over 90% of servers running the internet.) After quite a bit of work configuring everything, it looks like the sync was successful. The unix side of our server did force all (and I mean __ALL__) of the line endings to be changed to Unix format. This was very scary for a while. Now everythign looks to be settled, configured, and back in order. The server is running quite quickly I might add, and the site seems to be doing well. I will get back into developing the PayPal payment processing here in a moment, but there were a __lot__ of facets to that sync (due to the differences in the operating systems.) I am making sure to check and double check everything as to not lose any work, and to make sure that there is no overwritting or any other mal-code or database error. I still have a few checks to do with the database, but everything I've looked at so far looks to be running very smoothly.S
* Back into the PayPal development.
* Got an email about my internet setup. I am on the phone with them now. They're trying to make sure everything is in place for tomorrow... After speaking with the representitive, he says their system is down this morning. He did offer for his supervisor to give me a call back around Noon, eastern time.
* Today is going to be a busy day. I am going to start this morning back into the PayPal stuff. We left off yesterday with a response from PayPal with an error with the API credentials. I am going to assume, for now, that the shipping method thing is working well enough (this will need more attention later, but for now, it is working well enough.) Later on today, we will be working with KeywordSpy. I am going to be wrapping up development around 3PM so that we can move into some market research using KeywordSpy. Without much further ado, I'm going to jump right into it. I'll make another note once I have a better idea of what PayPal is doing, and how magento is passing / handling the request / response.

###2014-05-14###
* Install PHP GeoIp database. This is setup as mentioned below. This auto-fills the billing information (wherever possible), to enable the checkout to give shipping methods on page load. This should work now. I was in the JavaScript trying to force this to happen. that accounts for the edits to the checkout JS. The billing phtml file has a bunch of info on the GeoIp stuff. All this is commented in that file (see diff on the commit). Not too many style changes. I was working on setting up the PayPal processing, but I am getting bounced back with an API authentication error. As suggested on stackOverflow, I removed the authentication, cleared magento cache, and re-configured. This removed the buttons for a moment, and then re-loaded them. I have not gotten a chance to do another sandbox text, but this is where I left off. Check the pay_pal_error_log for more information. This is where I will need to pick up tomorrow. We moved on to looking into keyword research. We would like to start devoting a couple hours a day to this research. As mentioned, I would like to compare what I know about PrankDial.com to what we see with our competitors. I'm going to have to leave this note pretty much at that. Tomorrow morning, look at the commit, and start to figure out what is up with PayPal. Continue with payment processing, and work on figuring out what is going on with the PayPal credentials in the magento backend.
* I've continued set-up with PayPal. I still need to get the information over to paypal. But I was held up by the address information. I spent the last little while getting this set up as we talked about using the GeoIp. GeoIp is a paid service (at heart) but they do offer a free option. (which is what we used at TapFury, and worked well for them.) But I have been setting this up. This can be set up a multitude of way, and there are a vast amount of APIs and available options that go along with it. I spent a little time doing research on what would be the best method. I settled on running everything from PHP. This may prove to be a little slower, but I did leave the option open for the performance enhancing C plugin. This plugin is a server installed file, which enables the server to do the database searching (which is far faster), but in an effort to make sure everything is as portable as possible, I have PHP processing the database. All files related to this are going to be version controlled with git, and therefore there is no additional server set-up needed. Now that it is in place, it should just work. The amount of information provided by GeoIp is incredible. I will be able to pre-fill the City, State and Zipcode. This will enable Magento to calculate shipping right off the bat (which may take some configuring, but this will be code based), and that way we should not have to worry about what information is being sent to PayPal. All the user will be required to enter is their Full Name, Email, and Street Address. I am going to make Street Address be on one line, as a suite or apartment number really just needs to be appended to the first line. I will be removing Country completely, and I will have it update the state based on the zipcode. This will take some more code, but for now, I will have it pre-fill. As for PayPal, I will be configuring the hosted checkout pages (for paypal express checkout (like how eBay handles it)) and the credit card processing will be tested with the sandbox account. This is dependent on having all that billing information filled out, so this will be more perdinent soon. I will make another note once I have all the values pulling in correctly, and I am able to send the info to paypal, where I will (probably) get an error initially, and then have to configure the options it is expecting from there.
* After an extended period of time on the phone with PayPal, we were able to get the login issues all figured out. Now I have access to the Merchant Manager account, which will be the Live API setup, and I also now have access to the Sandbox and Developer account. The developer account is through larry@rattanoutdoorfurniture.com, This is displayed in the Merchant Manager page. I do not have direct access to this login, tho I may need it in the future, but we can cross that bridge when we get there. As for now, I am going to proceed with the aforementioned plan of attack, setting up all these paypal credentials into Magento, and continue to configure everything on PayPal's side, along with customizing the changes it impliments on our site. After the initial configuration, I see that Magento has tried to add a PayPal button to the cart, which i do not want it to do. As I had said, we would like to keep people on our site, and have PayPal act as a 3rd party payment processor.
* We have the PayPal payment processing set up on paypal's end. We have the API credentials, which are tied to the business account (Payments Pro). I will be entering this information into magento (this is all in the database). We also have the sandbox setup, with fake credit card, bank account and all other available payment processing types. Now, once I have all this information set in magento, it will begin the process of customizing the user experience. We are setting up the API, so that PayPal should work solely as a 3rd party processor. Ideally, we will send them the information given by the customer, and paypal should just process in the background and return with a success or error link. This is the destination page for after processing. We would like to not redirect to paypal (at all) if possible. And this is why we are doing this custom API development. There is a lot of customization to be done on the paypal end. It needs to know all the information related to our site, destination pages, and passible info, with required fields, and post payment processing handling (which is how our site handles the feedback from paypal). I will be spending the majority of the day configuring this on paypal's end. Once this is set-up, I will be moving back into handling the feedback on our end. I expect this to be something that takes the majority of the day. Paypal needs to be set before I can begin customizing the styles on the checkout, and before I can create those "destination" pages, which will be (as simply put as can be, error or success).
* Alright, a new day. rested and ready to go. We're working on setting up the payment processing through paypal today. Larry is calling them this morning. Once we get this configured (which will entail mostly some database setup) I would like to style the checkout section so that it mimics the layout of information on an actual credit card. We also discussed removing the city option. Magento needs at least a zip code to calculate shipping. We want to use the GeoIP database to try and guess what region the user is in, and try to auto fill the zipcode. If this is possible, I would like to offer a drop down of cities, that way the user just has to enter their street address, which I would also like to be on one line. I am going to start into this now, and I will make another note with progress on the address section of the checkout.

###2014-05-13###
* So, after the last few hours I have made some significant progress. I finished up the main navigation selected state (this works accross sub-categories and on product pages now), that was a quick fix. I spent the majority of my time in the checkout page, of course. I re-styled the coupon code section, to display nicer, and fit next to the guest password section. This is a section added, where It automatically attempts to create an account for you if you do not have one.  I made it so it gives you a temporary password, which we will email to the person. I decided to develop this option before messing with the login, as that is going to be a whole slue elements involved. I took a good majority of the recent time spent getting the shipping to work. It has been a little strange, but it now loads the free and flat-rate shipping options, adds them to the total, and displays the new additive total with shipping (if applicable) to the total in the review section. There are some other small style edits, but mostly just making things fit or feel natural on the page. I am still waiting to hear about paypal, so I do not want to spend much time on the credit card section, as we are most likely going to be removing that specific section, and I do not want to have to style it twice if i can avoid it. I was thinking we will style this much like it is in the designed page, where the layout of input elements mimic an actual credit card. We will have it automatically select card type based on number, I already looked into the Regular Expression required for this, and it is very easily do-able. I do still have a feeling that we may have an issue with shipping methods not showing as available until a destination address is given. This is something I would like to look into more.
* After that extended run, now that I have the checkout loading in to the layout very well, I want to work on the login section. This is just a slide-down box, with a login. I am going to look into adding facebook login. As mentioned before, I did do a little reasearch into this, and as expected, it does look like there are very many plugins to handle this sort of thing. If i do not have to re-write the code, I will do my best not to (as always). Beyond that, I am still waiting on paypal so I can configure payment processing. I do want to mess around with the payment opotions as that is going to greatly effect the layout in the checkout section. Also, magento is still not  allowing the user to see shipping options, as it is waiting for a destination before it calculates this. Shipping will be free (for the majority of orders) and there will be a flat rate for orders under a certain dollar amount. A lot of the configuration regarding these topics are facets of the magento database. So I will probably send about an hour working on the database configuration (I am thinking near the end of the day.)
* Okay, mostly have my head screwed back on straight now. That was a huge ego blow. Didn't really know how to handle it. But I just forged ahead, and have gotten some really good work done. The checkout is now installed into the design. With the 3 boxes, right column with review / submit section, and the collapssed cart box above the checkout form. I think this looks very nice, and does still print on a single (albeit vertical) page. I did quite a bit of work to consolidate the shipping/address form. The labels now move out of the way if the input box is empty (so they show as placeholders, and then move to being a label above the input box when the box is filled or in focus (being filled). I left the address line as is, I think I will consolidate this into 1 line, as the second part of the address can really just be at the end of the same box. Otherwise, it's coming together really well. I messed around with the review section for quite a while. I think I have it working pretty well, and I like the layout and functionality. I also took care of the "Selected" state in the menu. So when you click on "Products" it highlights the "Products" tab at the top of the page. This was something that enabled me to center myself, and get a handle on my abilities as a custom web developer who specializes in customization and bruteing through heavy layers of code to make highly customized websites. I needed this, personally. And I was able to fix it quickly. (in about 20 minutes).
* I am going to start back into the One Page Checkout section. I will be editing the Name & Address section. I would like to make the labels all be placeholders. If this is impractical, I would like to leave it open so that the labels can be shown if needed. Also, I want to fix the Shipping Method section. Where I believe it is looking for a destination on which to calculate shipping and show available options. I just want it to show Free from page load, so this will be my focus after attending to the labels.
* Start this morning looking over http://www.acousticpanels.com/; This is Mike's site developed by Corey. It looks nice, but is obviously a template. Despite my initial guess, this site is developed using OpenCart. They seem to have done a pretty good job loading up the site with content. None of this looks to be customized at all. I do not want to waste too much time with this. I have to start working on our own customization.

###2014-05-12###
* Fixing the One Page Checkout Styles. Working on the shipping methods. There's a small bug here. I styled the cart review (right column, tho I may put that box around it.) Working on consolidating the Left Column form to a less vertical layout. Perhaps we can remove the labels and use placeholders instead. This is where I will start in the morning. Beyond that, I fix the column layout, (which was rendering oddly), and moved some of the elements around. Made the login in the page heading. We can talk about this later too. Review Javascript should be pretty good.
* New checkout buttons in place. Form is looking far better. Need to do work on the sub-total section, but as far as progress, it's going very well. Larry wants my help with something over there for the rest of the day, i do believe, so I will backup and upload/sync everything now.
* We have the PayPal merchant account being set up over there by paypal. We have to wait a couple days on that. I'm moving forward with fixing the styles in the checkout page. I've been working on this for about 2 hours. Once I had things set and settled pretty well, I jumped right into this. We've discussed progress all day, but after I did the last push and commit, I finished up some of the configuration. And made sure everything was loading correctly. It was hanging on the payment methods for a while. I fixed this by just setting COD as the only option, we will configure paypal next, but we have to wait on paypal for the sandbox info. The AJAX was failing due to the secure connection. This was fixed by just removing the secure connection for development. (noted above). Now I am continuing to style the page, putting in buttons, and fixing sizing.
* Next I will continue customizing the One Page set-up. This is going to take some time. This will initially involve a lot of database changes. The code changes should come later today. I will start with the sub-system. Make sure that's all running correctly out of the database. Next I will work on the sub-system code to make sure everything is loading as it should. Then from there, I will begin tearing into it to generate our own custom styles. I am going to try to mimic our current design, but we will se how this goes. I will make notes as I make progress. I am planning on doing another code and DB push in a couple hours once I'm happy with the state of the database and code, before I go editing the internal code of the sub-system.
* Setup and install the rest of the One Page Checkout sub-system. I also put in place the GeoIP service code and data files. This will come into play soon, but will be categorized into the future (feature) development section. I am going to do a database backup and a code push to keep everything synced and in BitBucket.
* Install One Page Checkout sub-system. Do a dababase backup and code push, so we can always revert. This is part 1 of a 2 step process to install the code required to slim down the checkout to a single sectioned page. New Code and Database backup push.
* Manually check database backup to make sure there are not going to be consistancy issues. This was a problem before, and it was worth the 10 minutes to read through and make sure this will not be an issue in the future. After some attentive looking around, it does seem that the Magento Light Backup does work as intended. The database backup will be added to the commit now, and I will push. Then jump back into the checkout.
* I am going to being working on setting up the login / guest screen, and move into the next step from there. I will update this section of the notes with progress on this front.
* As we discussed. I need to widdle out some of the steps. It will be a 4 step process when completed. The first will be Login/Guest (for guest look into facebook integration, search for plugin for this, I am certain it exists. no need to re-write code.) Second will be Payment Info. We want their payment info as soon as we can. We're skipping shipping method (shipping will be free). And Billing Info will be used as the shipping info, I am going to have to figure out how we want to handle this, perhaps we extend the box with a second section for a seperate mailing address. The final step is Order Review and Confirm. This I will print out all the entered information, and the user will have to confirm and submit.
* Today's game plan starts with doing a little more reasearch into available options of how to handle the checkout experience, and find a few different ways other developers (or competitors) have handled this process. I would like this to  be as smooth and simple as possible.
* Talk with Larry this morning about a game plan for the checkout system. The time estimated is about 3 days to have this complete. I would like to have a completely functional main site (the main designed pages) by the end of the week so that Larry and I are able to go back through them and start  making changes.
* I will be commiting and pushing work from the second half of thursday, this morning, so that the code is all synced and backed up. I will do a new Light Backup on the local server before I upload, as to backup the database with the code state.

###2014-05-08###
* The cart update/clear functions still need some work. They expose at the bottom of the cart when you try to edit the quantity. I would like to develop the __edit cart__ method I suggested before (and I have a note, probably in here, and I know I do on my desk and in KEEP). So I may save this for later until I have time to do that. I will decide this after looking into it more. If it will be worth my time to fix it now, i will just do so, but if it's going to be something I want to spend more time on, I will come back to it. I want to start getting into the checkout process.
* I just finished re-styling the product page for the custom options section. I did this in the method as I had suggested before. Magento handles it how it likes, and I handle it how i want. I pass the values to magento, and everything is happy. Both products (with  or without color options) add to the cart. with a quantity that is limited by the inventory in magento.
* Finished up the right column on the cart page (Order Subtotal). This is pretty basic for now. It does try to account for tax and such, but I'm mostly leaving that alone for now. I'm mostly concerned about summing the additive total of each item's quantity with's it's unit price, added across all items in the cart. There is a small issue with updating the quantity once already in the cart. this is obviously a javascript issue, which I will come back to. I will make a note of it in the TODO section, and I am going to begin fixing the product page color options styles now. I am about 45 minutes ahead of where I thought I would be, So I am going to smoke, and then jump right back into the product page, so I can wrap that up and move on to the checkout. Been a very productive morning.
* I've got the new plugin installed. Everythign backed up, and I have synced the necessary files. Now I am going to begin working on the cart and checkout. I would like to wrap up the cart page by about noon, and I am going to just move right into the one-page checkout. This will be a huge part of the site that needs to be __EXTREMELY__ well tended to, and needs to be as smooth as possible. I believe this will take 2 or 3 days to get finalized, but it should also be very worth it. I will update progress around noon.
* After I get the code and database backed up and synced, I will jump right into styling the rest of the cart Order Subtotal (right column), and then move back into the product page, where I will style the color and quantity options (I am going to spend an appropriate amount of time with this, I want to be very careful, and make sure this works without any hiccups , so the add-to-cart and checkout process will be as smooth as possible.) From there I will be moving on to the checkout section, But I will make a note before I begin that.
* I just made those last 2 notes on yesterday. As mentioned, I am going to do my backup, saving, and uploading of work, so I have a clean start this morning, with everything saved and backed up as it should be according to the development process I've been using. (which directly saved us countless time already, and will continue to, so I am making sure this is done properly.)

###2014-05-07###
* Okay, yesterday I fixed the add-to-cart as mentioned. I left the product page add-to section un-styled for now. This is where I will pick up today. Both fake products (with and without colors) are adding to the cart, passing appropriate values (color and quantity) and the cart is styled. The order subtotal (right column) is where I left off. The sub-total is being calculated, but just needs to be displayed in the correct style (as designed, but it's very close. I will wrap this up this morning too.)
* The end of the day yesterday kind of snuck up on me. I did not get a chance to make my little end of day notes and upload my work. I did save everything, and did a local commit, so all my work would be safe, but I will go ahead now and do the database backup and do my normal backup, saving, and uploading process now. I'm going to make a note above this about what I finished yesterday.
* Okay, Fixed that little issue. It is definitely something that would have come back to bite me in the ass. The product is adding to the cart, Magento is logging as it should, and throwing NO ERRORS, this is very good. Now I will begin styling the cart, because I am confident that this process is quite solid.
* Now that everything is back in place here. Move on to the next issue. I would like to make sure that Magento's URL Logging isn't causeing issues. (Which is really shouldn't be, but it's throwing an error still, doesn't seem to be causing problems now, but it is something that needs some attention, and I do not want it to be an issue latter.)
* Finished re-basing (which is the industry term for this process) the code into the development branch, fixing the mal-edited Magento-core files. And Fix the Add-To-Cart bug. Removed the styling for the color and qty, but as noted below, this will be fixed soon, with the process I described. For now, I would like to just move on to the cart so I feel like I'm making significant progress, and I will come back to making the product page prettier.
* Last night I figured out how I am going to handle the product page color issue. I am going to let Magento handle it Magento's way, and I will display the colors swatches the way we want them to display. I will hide Magento's drop-down from user's view, and when they select the color swatch option, I will use javascript to set the Magento drop-down (hidden), so that passing values will not be an issue. And I can begin styling the cart. I am going to beign working on this, this is my initial morning note. So I will begin here, and update with another note on progress in an hour or so.

###2014-05-06###
* I FIXED IT!!!! It's not the prettiest, but as far as functionality goes, that's FAR more important. I can change the styles later. It just needs to work now. But the product is adding to the cart, with the color-swatch option, quantity, and price. Now, This is on a seperate branch, so i didn't break anything worse. I will merge these two tomorrow, but for today, I want to make sure the working version is accurately backed up, and so that no matter what, we can always revert back to this point where it works, and has the majority of the Theme installed.
* That didn't affect it. I'm going to clear the magento cache and sessions, as suggested  to do on the magento forum, and I'll re-index. Magento is just not pointing something to the right place, and at this point i'm honestly not sure what it is. If this does not work, I am going to go back to leafing through that hugh change set, and adding back in working elements. This had proved to be incredibly slow and tedious, so if i could have fixed it without having to do that, it would be better, but at this point, i am just not certain which method will come up with a solution in the least amount of time.
* Try to fix the issue from the suggestions on Magento's forum. This seems to suggest that the redirect may be caused by the "flat" category.
* Change the magento configuration to not redirect to the cart after adding a product. I've been meaning to do this, and I feel that now it will help figure out where the issue is (trying to remove any unneeded re-directs, so I can pin-point the place where it is failing.)
* I'm running two parallel instances of the magento store, where one has the code from where the add-to-cart worked, and the current (develop) which has the new template, but not working when add to cart.
* I was under the impression that the email was of priority number 1. I cannot afford to waste any more time on it, and need to get back into fixing this magento bug. So I am jumping back into that now.
* I just talked to Larry, I was working on setting up the info@nauticaldepot.com email on his laptop. Corey did not leave very much info on where everything is. After very much poking around, NauticalDeopt.com is registered with goDaddy, not sure where email is pointing to, if it's handled by goDaddy, or if by Network Solutions, which is who the domain seems to point to. He has this set up very oddly.
* The line below is referencing where the options are compiled (a sub-call) but the quantity controll element is defined here. Make sure EVERYTHING points where it should!
* See this: /* @var $this Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_View_Options */, search for it, app/design/frontend/base/default/template/catalog/product/view/options.phtml
* Progressing though the data in the exception. It is looking like I have a lock on the place where the bug is beginning.
* After the quick sync of data. Jump right into working on that bug. I am making another branch that will revert back to when i had the cart working, and I wil see what Magento changed. I am hoping this will work pretty easily. I also have the option of bypassing the Internal Integrity check, but this will more than likely cause security flaws, and is something I would like to avoid if at all possible. I will make another note in about an hour with progress.
* Back in the office today. Get everything synced up from development at home yesterday.

###2014-05-05##

* take advantage of git to figure this out. i made a commit when i got it to work, minus the layout of the buttons and qty. i'm going to make a new directory that reverts to when this worked, and then i will re-add back in the newer patches. This should be a more time-efficient way to fix this problem.
* Okay, I have to have it this time. The bug seems to be with the name of the control element. This should be an array of "options" values, with the option (i.e. 'color'), as the array key, and the passed value should be the option actually chosen by the customer.
* I think i might have just figured out what is wrong with the cart and i want to jot it down before i forget. I want to try to add each attribute to the form submit URL, delineated by forward slashes, key-value pairs. Do this with javascript. capture the button press. parse the current URL. add the color and quantity options. Mark product internal ID. and send to [root]/checkout/cart/add/[prop-pairs(product/1/qty/2/color/blue)...
* ___Stop working for today___. Just scared the HELL out of myself. (thought I lost all of the work i did today. nothing before today, but all of today wasted would have SUCKED!!!) There's no problem. But the database NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP WITH EVERY COMMIT! they are state related, and overlaps are not good! This is HIGHLY IMPORTANT for the future security, up-time and reliabilty of service.
* In the mix of fixing the add-to-cart issue, i ran into a bug with the images. For it to work the way we want, we will need 4 images per product. http://dev.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/products/loungers/brighton-sling-chaise-lounge-beta has the corrected images (but no coushoin colors, so you can't purchase it. the last note.)
* Fixed a partial issue... Related to the color and quantity selection. This also made me aware that if there is no color to be offered, Magento thinks the item is not for sale. How should we handle that?
* I was able to get internet on my laptop thru my phone. Got last weeks code updates and resources updates as well. Beginning working on the bug.
* Today Larry says we have the day off. That sounds great and all, but I can't afford to lose a day's work. So, with that said, I'm continuing to fix the add-to-cart bug. This can't be broken for another whole day. Progress must be made on the checkout, so this has to be completed as soon as possilble.

###2014-05-02###
* Work on a little bug that keeps plaguing me today with the cart details. I was hung up on this, then I stopped to work on the Laptop Recovery. I'm back working on it now. I will update this with details on the fix.
* Instead of moving past the colors, after talking to Larry, I thought this needed to just be fixed so i can move on to the cart. Fixed add to cart. Set and send color and quantity to cart. Working now on re-styling the quantity (now managed by magento too).
* Pulling in color options broke the Add-to-Cart functionality. This should be fixed. Needs to be styled on "container2" for add-to-buttons.
* Got the color options to pull into the product page. Now I'm about to make sure it gets passed to the cart, along with quantity.
* Continue on the product to cart process. Make sure color option and product gets added correctly and start styling the cart and checkout.
* Stop progress on the color swatches. Move this to a later date. Not a priority. we can manage it manually for now. Come back to this. Already added to the TODO.
* Get right back into the colors swatches custom product attribute. So we can manage the cushion color options from the magento admin.

###2014-05-01###
* Make it so you can add the product to the cart. The cart is still unstyled, but the products do add.
* Begin working on color options handled by magento.
* Fixes in the Product details section. Fix quantity to reflect inventory. fix price section. format price as currency.
* Fix the link to the product from the "Newest Products" page. Fixed that canonical / flat url problem with the url.
* Add a notice in the reviews box saying this feature is not available yet. (not a priority for launch). I added a bookmark link, so people can come back to the reviews section.
* Focus on the Product Detials tab box. Make this load the description and add a static block (same for every product) for the FAQ and Special. I think I will remove reviews for now. not needed at launch. add feature in later.
* Take a few minutes to talk to Lesley about a 1br house for rent. Schedule an appointment for later tonight? Also, reply to email regarding unlocked property. I would like to view these 2 tonight. Back into the product page now though.
* To remove Customer Product Tags: "To remove the product tags module (ie. not use product tags?  Admin->system->advanced-> Mage_Tag Disable"
* Take out the trash. And then back into the product page. Remove Customer Product Tagging. This is not a feature we need, at least especially not now. So i will disable it in the admin (require db update).
* I'm feeling pretty good with the product images for now. They pop-up and you can cycle thru them. and "Save Image As..." on right click works (we can make it not, if you'd like).
* Start at 8. Jump right into working on that product page more.

###2014-04-30###
* Some small amount of work done towards the product page. Continue this tomorrow.
* Spent most of the day working on finding a location to live at closer to work.

###2014-04-29###
* Continue working on the category / product linking, for now. once I have this to the point where it leads to no dead links, I will move on to styling the product page. I will come back to finalizing the canonicalization of the category/product links.
* Internet down this morning. Continuing with the category/product issues. I'm going to attempt to mostly just move ahead to the product page.

###2014-04-28###
* Setup all the site category pages, and lineage for flat url and logical url progression (The canonical link thing we talked about before.)
* Continue (move on past related products bug) with the product page. Add new markup, and begin styling.
* Working on a bug with the related products on the product page. This may be something that will solve itself when there are more products to be related to, but for now, change the logic in the "RelatedCategory" module (Related.php). For now just leave this with the fix added here. (@see: \Magebuzz__Relatedcategory_Block_Catalog_Product_List_Related::__prepareData )
* Work on category/product page lineage. "products" root category with url "../products" and sub-categories like "loungers" shouuld be "../products/loungers", and the individual product page would have a url something like "../products/loungers/brighton-sling-chaise-lounge"
* Finish working on the Browse (Category) page. Remove the ".html" from the link (Do this in the Admin interface / database update) Admin>System>Configuration>Catalog>Catalog>SEO>(Product & Category URL Suffix). This will require a flush of the cache.

###2014-04-25###
* List Products in browse. Get category logic fixed. Work on Category/Product view.
* Set Listing image dimensions in the magento backend. ___DO NOT FORGET TO UPLOAD DATABASE LATER___!
* Begin working on the product list (browse) page. Worry about 'selected' menu item later.

###2014-04-24###
* TODO: Next to be done, to be started tomorrow morning) continue syling the sub-pages: focus on the browse (/products.html) and product (/products/chairs/*.html) pages.
* Fixed 'About Us' menu issue, but need to fix the "selected" menu item code.
* At the end of the day, the home page should be pretty solid. The 'About Us' link in the header has a style issue when on sub-pages.
* Site structure looks good. Category and Product exist and are being read in place.
* Create fake product for system (there is going to have to be at least 1 category and 1 product for the store to make all the pages I will need to code. I am adding a fake category "Charis" which I am adding a fake product "Brighton Sling Chaise Lounge", which I will fill with the info from the design, for familiarity.
* Add FireGento plugin and php logger to help de-bug-ing.
* (3PM) Wrap up most of home page (complete for now). Fixed some elements in the header. Fix styles for main content area. Also fix footer styles, and fix issue causing footer to be extremely tall.
* Fix an issue with the navigation. it was only pulling in one item. Products would not show up. this is fixed. Next will be moving on to the footer.
* Get global search (in main nav bar) to be loaded through magento's sub-system for this. I was having issues, but it should be loading correctly now. This will need more work (to make the search actually work). Leave this the way it is for now, and come back to it. Move onto footer.
* Fix main nav to auto-load pages. Manually add Home link and Blog link.
* Pick back up where I had left off yesterday. Get list elements to read correctly. Fix classes for top nav and main nav.

###2014-04-23###
* Finish day with files open in location of last edits. In the middle of editing the main navigation.
* Note: var linkData = [];jQuery("li[data-link-data]").each(function(){linkData.push(jQuery.parseJSON($(this).attr('data-link-data')))});
* Disable wishlist in magento admin. I am just going to disable the wishlist plugin thru the magento admin panel. If this is something we want to re-enable later, that can be done, but for now, I do not want to waste time with it if we are not even using it now. System>Configuration>Customers>Wishlist>Enabled=No
* Begin creating new design layouts in magento. Pick up with the 1 column layout, where the header is being put in place. Continue working on header, and menues. The navigation must be edited across the magento file structure. The separation of files, while it will be nice later, is currently complicating getting everything in place.

###2014-04-22###
* Begin the magento install of the new Design pages. Start with the 1 column layout which everything else will be built off of. Started this process. Layout file is updated, and the 'head' of the page is tentatively in place. Need to continue working on the page header along with the menues.
