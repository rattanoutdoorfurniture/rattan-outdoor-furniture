Kansas

Although you are know for your flat lands, as a resident of Kansas, you're well aware of the rocky terrain at Kanopolis State Park and the view atop Mount Sunflower. Once populated by the Kansas tribe, the people of the wind hold a legacy still flowing in the river valleys as they whisper secrets in the prairie breeze. Breathe in the life from your farmlands and frolic in the sunflower filled fields only to discover the comfort of your Kansas home is also found on every inch of our handcrafted products.
