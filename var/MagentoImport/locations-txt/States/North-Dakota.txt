North Dakota
 
The rich soils of the Sheyenne Delta give life to about 2,000 species of vegetation and provide North Dakota with the production of abounding agriculture growth. A region filled with natural gas, lignite coal and fossil fuels, there is plenty to be thankful for in the Roughrider State. The ravines and valley along Pembina Gorge can only be matched by the northern Badlands. The surrounding hills of Devil's Lake are actually reflecting a piece of heaven onto North Dakota's terrain. From atop the Turtle Mountains to the dunes of McHenry County, North Dakota is full of natures majestic beauty. Rattan Outdoor Furniture only adds to that beauty with products made to display the heart of your home.
