Minnesota 


Agriculture, outstretched prairies and green forests remain the focal point of your Minnesota landscape. The tilted rock beds line the Middle Precambrian Thompson Formation located at Jay Cooke State Park as the Gopher State is settled in the lush wilderness. Eagle Mountain entices visitors by its surrounding waters and pine tree covered soils. Experience Chippewa National Forest, the Mississippi Flyway and count the soaring eagles while keeping in mind, our products are ornate in comfort throughout Minnesota. Check out what Minnesota has to offer you at www.mn.gov and support the thriving communities which surround you with Rattan Outdoor Furniture.
