Vermont


With a motto of Freedom and Unity, Vermont embodies the basic fundamentals of the United States. From the Appalachian National Scenic Trail to the ever flowing Winhall River, you invite visitors from afar to grasp a small piece of your picturesque surroundings. Your wildlife harnesses the trails of the eastern cottontail rabbit, the migration of the blue-winged warbler and the soft warnings of the Eastern timber rattlesnake. At Rattan Outdoor Furniture, we believe all of Vermont should be celebrated with our gorgeously crafted products. Learn more about the world around you at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont and embrace all that your state provides by researching Vermont's services at www.vermont.gov.
