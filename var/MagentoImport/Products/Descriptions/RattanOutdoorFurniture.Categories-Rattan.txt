Outdoor Screens


Do you ever get the desire to go outside and relax on your rattan furniture but find the sights and sounds of those around you distracting? Outdoor screens are not only visually appealing, but they are also the perfect means for enacting privacy around pools, patios, or porches. Whether you use our outdoor screens to create a more intimate and conversational furniture area for friends and family or to sunbathe by the pool without feeling self-conscious, these outdoor screens will enhance any outside setting with their distinctly decorative accents. Handcrafted from light-weight yet strong resin material, you can count on our outdoor screens to stand against the wind alongside our other rattan furniture without losing their aesthetic qualities. We offer traditional folding outdoor screens or ones that can be rolled up, though all of our outdoor screens are 100% hand-woven and allow sunlight to still shine through. Our rattan outdoor screens come in myriad designs and styles. Many customers have enjoyed our outdoor screens with honeycomb or diamond weaves, while others have been rather fond of our outdoor screens with angled corners or arched tops.
