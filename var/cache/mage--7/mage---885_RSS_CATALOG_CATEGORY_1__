      <title><![CDATA[The Brighton Collection]]></title>
      <link>https://www.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/blog/the-brighton-collection/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span>Rattan Outdoor Furniture is presenting their new collection! The Brighton Collection is coming out at the peak of spring with a style that caters to just about everybody. This collection has been inspired by the beach (think of Brighton Beach and the Atlantic Coastline) and featuring a design which truly invites leisure onto your patio.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img title="Rattan Outdoor Furniture Brighton Collection Chairs" src="https://www.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/media/wysiwyg/BlogPhotos/brighton-1.jpg" alt="Rattan Outdoor Furniture Brighton Collection Chairs" /></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Now, some may ask, where do I begin? Should you be looking at deck chairs, the all inclusive dining set or should you go for the nine piece sectional? The answer really is simple because there really is no wrong place to start. With the Brighton Collection, it is catered to your needs. If you're looking for a piece which will accommodate a large group but is easily rearranged for smaller gatherings, then the sectional may be the perfect item for your poolside or porch. If you already have chairs available, take a look at the tables with incredible handcrafted details that can easily blend into your existing decor. Buying outdoor furniture which caters to your needs is quickly done through the Brighton Collection with an amazing selection of both wicker and rattan woven furniture.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Brighton collection has the amazing advancement of RAUCORD and Viro brand resin so whether you're looking for wicker or rattan, the recycled material is not only eco-friendly but doesn't have the constant maintenance worries of real wicker and rattan. The use of plastic resin has become a growing trend in the outdoor furniture business because of it's easy "wipe with water and soap" cleaning methods. Although Rattan Outdoor Furniture has taken this technology to the next level by adding rust free aluminum frames which have been powder coated.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The longevity and durability offered on the Brighton Collection is consider top-rate but the aesthetics offer even more to love. Vibrant and softly textured fabrics can be bought in Rattan Outdoor Furniture's exclusive Allure line (which was recently ranked in the top 10 as an industry favorite) or try the reliable Sunbrella line. Both options will elevate your outdoors with the year's hottest trend setting colors. Soft blues, neutral beiges and even a more eccentric yellow are becoming widely used as a way to brighten your outdoors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img title="Rattan Outdoor Furniture Brighton Collection Loungers" src="https://www.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/media/wysiwyg/BlogPhotos/brighton-2.jpg" alt="Rattan Outdoor Furniture Brighton Collection Loungers" /></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It's true sometimes there is a lot to consider when a new furniture collection is released to the world but the Brighton Collection truly encompasses a unique sense of style with water-resistant materials and eclectic designs. The innovating techniques used are truly in a class all of their own and represent a new day in modern and casual furnishings, but the number reason to buy Rattan Outdoor Furniture's new Brighton Collection is quite honestly, the price. It's already priced considerably lower than the new collections of fellow competitors but is also sold with a 60 day guarantee. Meaning if in the next two month, Rattan Outdoor Furniture's site slashes the prices of our Brighton Collection or another business has the Brighton Collection listed at a lower price, you'll get a refund.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sometimes the unveiling of a new product line means exclusive availability but it's pretty clear Rattan Outdoor Furniture wants everyone to take the opportunity to own a piece of the Brighton Collection. Become inspired to elevate your outdoors to a whole new level and incorporate a day at the beach all year round. Highly recommending the Brighton Collection just doesn't seem like enough, because the collection truly exuberates perfection.</span></p>

      <title><![CDATA[High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)]]></title>
      <link>https://www.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/blog/high-density-polyethylene-hdpe/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span>Why should you look for High-density polyethylene in your Rattan Outdoor Furniture?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There has been a big push recently for the use of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in outdoor furniture. This material is exclusively found in all of Rattan Outdoor Furniture's products and there is a good reason for this. In short, it has proven longevity and endurance. But let's get into more details about the material and its many properties.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img title="High Density Polyethylene" src="https://www.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/media/wysiwyg/BlogPhotos/hdpe-1.jpg" alt="High Density Polyethylene" /></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>What exactly is high-density polyethylene? It's an extremely versatile material derived from plastic but the HDPE we use has additives that strengthen the product with durability that you won't find in your plastic water bottle. The superior tensile strength and weather resistance is what has made HDPE an industry favorite but it's favorability among consumers comes with its aesthetic appeal and easy maintenance. Before the use <img style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 0 0;" title="High Density Polyethylene Cord" src="https://www.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/media/wysiwyg/BlogPhotos/hdpe-2.jpg" alt="High Density Polyethylene Cord" />of HDPE in outdoor patio furniture, you had the choice of real rattan or wicker which was gorgeous in appearance but came with strenuous seasonal maintenance along with the added minus of easily being splintered. Plus let's not forget rattan and wicker are constructed from a plant meaning your furniture could literally retain moisture and rot if not properly finished every year, and let's not forget the absorption of moisture means the growth of harmful bacteria and other microscopic germs. HDPE took all those hazards out of the picture so what you're left with is pure outdoor enjoyment and the benefit of easy cleaning with soap and water.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Rattan Outdoor Furniture has chosen high-density polyethylene as their prime choice of material to accompany their trust strength of aluminum powder coated frames and water resistant Allure fabrics for the simple reason that it encompasses their promise of all-weather protection. Making outdoor patio furniture could be an easy task if you want to just shovel furniture pieces out without a care whether it will retain sustainable on your patio tomorrow, but that's not the philosophy of Rattan Outdoor Furniture. Constructing viable patio furniture with the maximum strength for all applications and weather conditions mean, using a high-resistant HDPE. The HDPE acquired through Rattan Outdoor Furniture is top-grade and although when you sit on that sectional, loveseat or chaise lounger, you may immediately think comfort, in the back of your mind you can now at the words, lasting resilience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0;" title="Woven High Density Polyethylene" src="https://www.rattanoutdoorfurniture.com/media/wysiwyg/BlogPhotos/hdpe-3.jpg" alt="Woven High Density Polyethylene" />HDPE has another benefit and that is the everlasting color. Some materials used in today's market are clay based meaning when the color is added, it will only lay on the top. The color added to HDPE is added into the base itself meaning it is incorporated into every fiber of your furniture. Fading and color touchups have nearly become a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Adding HDPE to the mix has enabled Rattan Outdoor Furniture's artisans to handcraft incredible designs which will remain elegant and strong year after years and it encourages their customers to become inspired by the future not just the present. Taking current trends to the next level and using innovating HDPE has enabled master craftsmen to truly create cherished furniture pieces that will innately last for years to come.</span></p>]]></description>
