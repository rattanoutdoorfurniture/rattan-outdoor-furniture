*Note: var linkData = [];jQuery("li[data-link-data]").each(function(){linkData.push(jQuery.parseJSON($(this).attr('data-link-data')))});
*Disable wishlist in magento admin. I am just going to disable the wishlist plugin thru the magento admin panel. If this is something we want to re-enable later, that can be done, but for now, I do not want to waste time with it if we are not even using it now. System>Configuration>Customers>Wishlist>Enabled=No
*Begin creating new design layouts in magento. Pick up with the 1 column layout, where the header is being put in place. Continue working on header, and menues. The navigation must be edited across the magento file structure. The separation of files, while it will be nice later, is currently complicating getting everything in place.

###2014-04-22###
*Begin the magento install of the new Design pages. Start with the 1 column layout which everything else will be built off of. Started this process. Layout file is updated, and the 'head' of the page is tentatively in place. Need to continue working on the page header along with the menues.
